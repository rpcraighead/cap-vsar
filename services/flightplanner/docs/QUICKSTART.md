# Quick Start — CAP 487 Flight Planner

Plan your first route in about a minute. We'll fly
**KSEE → JLI → TRM → KPSP** (Gillespie Field, over the Julian and Thermal VORs,
into Palm Springs).

> ⚠️ **SIM USE ONLY** — weather is partly simulated. Brief with official sources
> before any real flight.

## 1. Open the app

- **Public:** https://flightplanner.rpc-cyberflight.com
- **Local:** http://198.51.100.236:5001

Check the pill in the top-right shows an airport count (e.g. `32,553 apts`),
not `No data`.

## 2. Type the route

In the route box at the top, type (it auto-uppercases):

```
KSEE JLI TRM KPSP
```

Departure first, destination last, spaces between. `KSEE`/`KPSP` are airports;
`JLI`/`TRM` are VORs.

## 3. Set cruise

- **Altitude:** `9,500 ft`
- **RPM:** `2400 (55%)` (default)
- **Reserve:** `45 min` (default)

## 4. Press **Fly**

The route draws on the map and the **Flight Log** drawer opens at the bottom.

## 5. Read the log

- **Summary strip:** ~85 NM, ~74 min, ~19 gal, winds.
- **Nav log table:** per-leg DIST / TC / **MH** / GS / TIME / FUEL. (Magnetic
  headings run ~11° less than true course — that's SoCal magnetic variation.)
- Exact time/fuel/heading numbers vary with the current winds aloft (live GFS forecast).

## 6. Look around the tabs

- **Terrain** — profile + Min Clearance badge vs your 9,500 ft cruise.
- **Weather** — METARs (live if reachable) + live GFS winds aloft.
- **Airports** — runways for KSEE and KPSP.

## 7. Edit on the map (the fun part)

- Every leg has a **white midpoint dot** — drag it to bend the route.
- Drop it on or near a fix → pick from the **top-3 snap** menu, or
- Hold **Shift** and release to drop a **user waypoint** at that exact spot.
- **Click** an intermediate waypoint to **remove** it.

The route and nav log recompute automatically after every edit.

## 8. Generate a CAP Search Pattern

1. Click the **SAR** button in the toolbar.
2. Select the pattern type: **Expanding Square**, **Creeping Line**, or **Parallel Track**.
3. Pick a datum on the map or type coordinates, adjust track spacing and legs.
4. Click **Generate Pattern** to preview the search grid.
5. Use **Apply to Route** to update your nav log, **Export .FMS** for X-Plane 12, or **Push to V-SAR** to send the sortie to the exercise console (`ms01:8700`).
